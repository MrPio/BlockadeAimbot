## BlockadeAimbot
 An aimbot project test to cheat in a game protected by Easy Anti Cheat 

 Two modes are supported:
 - Aim to enemy colours (red, blue, green) and faces
 - Aim to screen-detected movements

While Easy Anti Cheat seems to block almost all the libraries performing fake mouse movement, `win32api.mouse_event()` seems to deceive it. Furthermore, a slight delay in movement to simulate a human gesture was introduced.
